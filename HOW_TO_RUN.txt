NOTE: I created and tested this project in Java version 17.0.1

Input files are to be in the following format:

[number of processes]
[number of resources] [number of instances for R0, R1, ..., Rn]
[request/release] [process number] [resource number] [number of instances of resource]

An example would be:

3
4   1 2 1 3
request 1 0 1

Input files are not to have any extra comments or number or the project will not run properly. This folder
contains three separate files that can be used to test the project (the example files provided on the website)

HOW TO RUN: 
1. Go to the directory containing the jar file in command line

2. Enter 'java -jar ResourceManager.jar [file name]'. For example:
	java -jar ResourceManager.jar NoDeadlock.txt

3. A window will appear with a button that says 'start'. Press start to begin the simulation.

4. The window will now show a graphical representation of the simulation. To go to the next step within
	the input file, press the button that says 'Next Step'. 

5. Each time the button is pressed, the graphics in the window will update to show what has happened. Along
	with this, there will be information within the command line terminal that gives a more in depth
	explanation of what has happened and whether or not there is deadlock.

6. When there are no more steps, pressing the 'Next Step' button will result in "End of file" being printed
	in the terminal. To finish running, press the 'X' button in the window of the graphics.
